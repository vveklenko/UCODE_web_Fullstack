    <h1 align="center">PROTOCOLS</h1>
    <div class="html">
        <div class="pblock"><p>HTTP <br>
            <br>
            HTTP defines a set of request methods to indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resource. Although they can also be nouns, these request methods are sometimes referred to as HTTP verbs. Each of them implements a different semantic, but some common features are shared by a group of them: e.g. a request method can be safe, idempotent, or cacheable. <br>
            <br>
            Request Methods <br>
            <br>
            GET – requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data.<br>
            POST – used to submit an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.<br>
            HEAD – used to submit an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.<br>
            PUT – replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.<br>
            DELETE – deletes the specified resource.<br>
            CONNECT – establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource.<br>
            OPTIONS – used to describe the communication options for the target resource.<br>
            TRACE – performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.<br>
            PATCH – used to apply partial modifications to a resource.<br>
            <br>
            Responce Status Codes Classes<br>
            <br>
            100 – 199 – Informational responses.<br>
            200 – 299 – Successful responses.<br>
            300 – 399 – Redirects.<br>
            400 – 499 – Client errors.<br>
            500 – 599 – Server errors.<br>
        </p></div>
        <div class="pblock"> HTTPS<br>
            <br>
            HTTPS is an encrypted version of the HTTP protocol. It uses SSL or TLS to encrypt all communication between a client and a server. This secure connection allows clients to safely exchange sensitive data with a server, such as when performing banking activities or online shopping. <br>
            <br>
            Request Methods <br>
            <br>
            GET – requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data.<br>
            POST – used to submit an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.<br>

            PUT – replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.<br>
            DELETE – deletes the specified resource.<br>
            CONNECT – establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource.<br>
            OPTIONS – used to describe the communication options for the target resource.<br>
            TRACE – performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.<br>

        <div class="pblock"><p>DNS<br>
            <br>
            DNS is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for Internet connected resources. DNS maintains a list of domain names along with the resources, such as IP addresses, that are associated with them. <br>
            <br>
            A – The A-record is the most basic and the most commonly used DNS record type. It is used to translate human friendly domain names such as "www.example.com" into IP-addresses such as 23.211.43.53 (machine friendly numbers).<br>
            AAAA – An AAAA-record is used to specify the IPv6 address for a host (equivalent of the A-record type for IPv4). IPv6 is the future replacement for the current IP address system (also known as IPv4).<br>
            ALIAS – ALIAS-records are virtual alias records resolved by Simple DNS Plus at at the time of each request - providing "flattened" (no CNAME-record chain) synthesized records with data from a hidden source name. This can be used for different purposes - including solving the classic problem with CNAME-records at the domain apex (for the zone name / for "the naked domain").<br>
            CNAME – CNAME-records are domain name aliases. Computers on the Internet often performs multiple roles such as web-server, ftp-server, chat-server etc. To mask this, CNAME-records can be used to give a single computer multiple names (aliases).<br>
            MX – MX-records are used to specify the e-mail server(s) responsible for a domain name. Each MX-record points to the name of an e-mail server and holds a preference number for that server. If a domain name is handled by multiple e-mail servers (for backup/redundancy), a separate MX-record is used for each e-mail server, and the preference numbers then determine in which order (lower numbers first) these servers should be used by other e-mail servers.<br>

        <div class="pblock"><p>IP<br>
            <br>
            An IP address is a number assigned to every device connected to a network that uses the Internet protocol. "IP address" typically still refers to 32-bit IPv4 addresses until IPv6 is deployed more broadly.<br>
