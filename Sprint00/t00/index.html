    <h2 id = "first">What makes a superhero?</h2>
    <p>A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person couldn’t. So in order to be a superhero, 
        <b>you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human being could possess</b>, and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds. 
        Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero. 
        <br>For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective story or human-interest story. 
        But if it’s a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. 
        If the good guy is doing something that a normal human being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.</p>
