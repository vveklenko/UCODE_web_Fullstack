                    The Eye of Agamotto is an ancient artifact, a pendant created by Agamotto, the first Sorcerer Supreme, 
                    presumably to contain and harness the power of the green Time Stone contained inside. After being stored for an unknown amount of time on a pedestal in Kamar-Taj, it was recently wielded by Doctor Stephen Strange, first to aid him in his learning of sorcery, then in his final fight against 
                    Kaecilius and Dormammu.

                    The Power Stone is an incredible power source, it increases the user's physical abilities and allows 
                    it to manipulate energy, which, when used at full potential, has enough power to obliterate an entire 
                    planet when unleashed. This stone was sought by Thanos, who tasked Ronan the Accuser to acquire it from 
                    the dead planet of Morag, in exchange for destroying Xandar. However, Star-Lord acquired the stone first 
                    and was prepared to sell it to Taneleer Tivan ("The Collector") with Gamora until its destructive power 
                    was unleashed at Knowhere.

                    The Tesseract is named for its cube-like appearance and is capable of controlling space itself, 
                    providing the user instant access to any location throughout the universe if used correctly. 
                    The unique element that composes the Tesseract has also been used to create advanced weaponry by races 
                    like the Humans. This stone played an important role in humanity's development during the dawn of the 
                    superhero age, attracting the attention of forces such as Red Skull and Thanos, both of whom sought 
                    to use the Tesseract's power for their own sinister intents.

                    The Scepter was a weapon that utilized the yellow Mind Stone housed inside a blue computer module, 
                    which also masked the stone's presence. Stark originally saw the Stone as a power source, whereas 
                    once J.A.R.V.I.S. had the opportunity to study the stone he stated it was more akin to a very powerful
                    computer. The stone within had already been in the possession of Thanos when he gave it to Loki to aid 
                    him in his invasion of Earth. It grants to the user powerful mental abilities, like the power to subjugate 
                    the minds of others, bending them to the will of the user, as well as project the user's consciousness to a 
                    higher plane of existence.

                    The Aether appears as a dark, red, viscous liquid. It acts as a symbiotic force, capable of being 
                    absorbed into the body of a living host, giving the user the ability to warp reality at will, 
                    granting that person immense strength, durability, powers, and subjective influence over the universe.
                    Malekith planned to use the Aether's reality-bending abilities to cover all Nine Realms in darkness; 
                    however, he was stopped by the combined efforts of Thor and Jane Foster.
